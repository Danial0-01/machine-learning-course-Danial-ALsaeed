# Lab 1: Git and GitHub Setup

## Exploration of Git and GitHub
During this lab I explored how Git works as a version control system on my local machine and how GitHub acts as a cloud-based hosting service for my repositories. I learned how to use GitHub Desktop to sync changes between my local disk and the online server.

## Steps Followed
1. Account Creation: Created a GitHub account at github.com using my email.
2. Repository Setup: Created the main repository `machine-learning-course-Danial-AlSaeed` on the GitHub website.
3. Local Cloning: Used GitHub Desktop to clone the repository to my local disk.
4. Organization: Created a dedicated `Lab1` folder to house this documentation.
